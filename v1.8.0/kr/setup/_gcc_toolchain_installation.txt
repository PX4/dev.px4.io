<!-- GCC toolchain documentation used for all Linux platforms to build NuttX -->

Execute the script below to install 5.4:

```sh
pushd .
cd ~
wget https://launchpad.net/gcc-arm-embedded/5.0/5-2016-q2-update/+download/gcc-arm-none-eabi-5_4-2016q2-20160622-linux.tar.bz2
tar -jxf gcc-arm-none-eabi-5_4-2016q2-20160622-linux.tar.bz2
exportline="export PATH=$HOME/gcc-arm-none-eabi-5_4-2016q2/bin:\$PATH"
if grep -Fxq "$exportline" ~/.bash_profile; then echo nothing to do ; else echo $exportline >> ~/.profile; fi
popd
```

Now restart your machine.

**If using Debian Linux, run this command:**

```sh
sudo dpkg --add-architecture i386
sudo apt-get update
```

**Then install the 32 bit support libraries** (this might fail and can be skipped if running a 32 bit OS):

```sh
sudo apt-get install libc6:i386 libgcc1:i386 libstdc++5:i386 libstdc++6:i386
sudo apt-get install gcc-4.6-base:i386 
```


**Troubleshooting**

Check the version by entering the following command:

```sh
arm-none-eabi-gcc --version
```

The output should be something similar to:

```sh
arm-none-eabi-gcc (GNU Tools for ARM Embedded Processors) 5.4.1 20160609 (release) [ARM/embedded-5-branch revision 237715]
Copyright (C) 2015 Free Software Foundation, Inc.
This is free software; see the source for copying conditions.  There is NO
warranty; not even for MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.
```

If you get the following output, make sure you have the 32bit libs installed properly as described in the installation steps:

```sh
arm-none-eabi-gcc --version
arm-none-eabi-gcc: No such file or directory
```
