# Robotics using ROS

[ROS](http://www.ros.org/) (Robot Operating System) is a general purpose robotics library that can be used with PX4 for [offboard control](../ros/mavros_offboard.md). It uses the [MAVROS](../ros/mavros_installation.md) node to communicate with PX4 running on hardware or using the [Gazebo Simulator](../simulation/ros_interface.md).

This section contains topics about using ROS for offboard control with PX4.

> **Tip** ROS is only officially supported on Linux platforms.
