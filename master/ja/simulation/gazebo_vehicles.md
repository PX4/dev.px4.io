# Gazebo Vehicles

This topic lists/displays the vehicles supported by the PX4 [Gazebo](../simulation/gazebo.md) simulation and the `make` commands required to run them (the commands are run from a terminal in the **Firmware** directory).

Supported vehicle types include: mutirotors, VTOL, VTOL Tailsitter, Plane, Rover, Submarine/UUV.

> **Tip** For the full list of build targets run `make px4_sitl list_vmd_make_targets` (and filter on those that start with `gazebo_`).

<span></span>
> **Note** The [Gazebo](../simulation/gazebo.md) page shows how to install Gazebo, how to enable video and load custom maps, and many other configuration options.

> **Note** This target also supports [video streaming simulation](#video).

## Plane/Fixed Wing {#fixed_wing}

### Standard Plane {#standard_plane}

```sh
make px4_sitl gazebo_plane
```

![Plane in Gazebo](../../assets/simulation/gazebo/vehicles/plane.png)


#### Standard Plane with Catapult Launch {#standard_plane_catapult}

```sh
make px4_sitl gazebo_plane_catapult
```

This model simulates hand/catapult launch, which can be used for [fixed wing takeoff](http://docs.px4.io/master/en/flying/fixed_wing_takeoff.html#fixed-wing-takeoff) in position mode, takeoff mode, or missions.

The plane will automatically be launched as soon as the vehicle is armed.


## VTOL

### Standard VTOL {#standard_vtol}

```sh
make px4_sitl gazebo_standard_vtol
```

![Standard VTOL in Gazebo](../../assets/simulation/gazebo/vehicles/standard_vtol.png)

### Tailsitter VTOL {#tailsitter_vtol}

```sh
make px4_sitl gazebo_tailsitter
```

## Unmmanned Ground Vehicle (UGV/Rover/Car) {#ugv}

### Ackerman UGV {#ugv_ackerman}

```sh
make px4_sitl gazebo_rover
```

![Rover in Gazebo](../../assets/simulation/gazebo/vehicles/rover.png)

### Differential UGV {#ugv_differential}

```sh
make px4_sitl gazebo_r1_rover
```

## Unmanned Underwater Vehicle (UUV/Submarine) {#uuv}

### HippoCampus TUHH UUV {#uuv_hippocampus}

```sh
make px4_sitl gazebo_uuv_hippocampus
```

## Unmanned Surface Vehicle (USV/Boat) {#usv}

### Boat {#usv_boat}

```sh
make px4_sitl gazebo_boat
```

## Airship {#airship}

### Cloudship {#cloudship}

```sh
make px4_sitl gazebo_cloudship
```
