# AirSim Simulation

AirSim is a open-source, cross platform simulator for drones, built on Unreal Engine. It provides physically and visually realistic simulations of Pixhawk/PX4 using either Hardware-In-The-Loop \(HITL\) or Software-In-The-Loop \(SITL\).

The main entry point for the documentation is the [Github AirSim README](https://github.com/Microsoft/AirSim/blob/master/README.md).

The main entry point for documentation on working with PX4 is [PX4 Setup for AirSim](https://github.com/Microsoft/AirSim/blob/master/docs/px4_setup.md) (covering both HITL and SITL).
