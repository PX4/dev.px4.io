# Development Environment on ArchLinux

> **Note** These instructions allow you to build PX4 (without RTPS) for NuttX targets, using an unsupported version of GCCE from the package manager. The instructions have been tested on Antergos (an Arch Linux based distribution) as it is easier to set up than Arch Linux. We hope to provide fully tested instructions with the supported toolchain in the near future.

## Permissions

The user needs to be added to the group "uucp":

```sh
sudo usermod -a -G uucp $USER
```

Then log out and log in for changes to take effect.

## Script-based Installation

> **Note** This script installs the (unsupported) latest GCCE from the package manager. MicroRTPS is not built.

Once ArchLinux is installed you can use the docker script [archlinux_install_script.sh](https://github.com/PX4/containers/blob/master/docker/px4-dev/scripts/archlinux_install_script.sh) to install all dependencies required for building PX4 firmware.

To install using this script, enter the following in a terminal:

```sh
wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/PX4/containers/master/docker/px4-dev/scripts/archlinux_install_script.sh
sudo -s
source ./archlinux_install_script.sh
```

<!-- 
> Follow the instructions [below](#gcc-toolchain-installation) to install the supported version.
-->

## Manual Installation

### Common Dependencies

To install the dependencies manually, enter the following lines into a terminal.

```sh
# Common dependencies for all targets
sudo pacman -Sy --noconfirm \
    base-devel make cmake ccache git \
    ninja python-pip tar unzip zip vim wget

# Install Python dependencies
pip install serial empy numpy toml jinja2 pyyaml cerberus

# Install genromfs
wget https://sourceforge.net/projects/romfs/files/genromfs/0.5.2/genromfs-0.5.2.tar.gz
tar zxvf genromfs-0.5.2.tar.gz
cd genromfs-0.5.2 && make && make install && cd ..
rm genromfs-0.5.2.tar.gz genromfs-0.5.2 -r 
```

> **Note** *genromfs* is also available in the [Archlinux User Repository](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/genromfs/) (AUR). To use this package, install [yaourt](https://archlinux.fr/yaourt-en) (Yet AnOther User Repository Tool) and then use it to download, compile and install *genromfs* as shown: 
> 
>     sh
>       yaourt -S genromfs

### GCCE Compiler

A GCC compiler is required to build for NuttX targets. Enter the command below to install the latest version from the package manager (unsupported).

    # Compiler from package manager (unsupported)
    sudo pacman -Sy --noconfirm \
        arm-none-eabi-gcc arm-none-eabi-newlib
    

*Alternatively*, the standard instructions for installing the **official** version are listed below.

> **Note** These are untested. Attempt them at your own risk!
