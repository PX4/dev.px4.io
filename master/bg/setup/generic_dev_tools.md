## Editor / IDE

The development team often use:

* [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/): quite new, popular open source IDE
* [Eclipse for C/C++](https://www.eclipse.org/downloads/eclipse-packages/): very feature rich Java based IDE
* [Sublime Text](https://www.sublimetext.com): a fast and lean text editor. 
* [Qt Creator](http://www.qt.io/download-open-source/#section-6): A popular open-source IDE.

> **Note** On linux the installation scripts automatically install *Qt Creator* as part of the common dependencies. You can launch it by entering `qtcreator` in a bash terminal.
