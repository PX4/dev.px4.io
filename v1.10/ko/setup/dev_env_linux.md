# 리눅스 개발환경

Linux allows you to build for [all PX4 targets](../setup/dev_env.md#supported-targets) (NuttX based hardware, Qualcomm Snapdragon Flight hardware, Bebop, Linux-based hardware, Simulation, ROS).

> **Tip** [Ubuntu Linux LTS](../setup/dev_env_linux_ubuntu.md) 16.04 is recommended. Other environments can be made to work, but are less well tested and documented.

The following instructions explain how to set up a development environment on various Linux platforms.

- [Ubuntu/Debian Linux](../setup/dev_env_linux_ubuntu.md) - Recommended!
- [CentOS Linux](../setup/dev_env_linux_centos.md)
- [Arch Linux](../setup/dev_env_linux_arch.md)
- [Advanced Linux](../setup/dev_env_advanced_linux.md)

After setting up the build/simulation toolchain:

- [Additional Tools](../setup/generic_dev_tools.md) lists some other useful tools.
- [Build instructions](../setup/building_px4.md) explains how to download and build PX4 source code.
