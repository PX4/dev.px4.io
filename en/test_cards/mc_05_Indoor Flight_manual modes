# MC_05 - Indoor Flight - Manual modes

## When to use this test card

* New build maiden flight

* When required to replicate an issue in a confined area

* Experimental builds that might have stability issues

* Testing hardware that has been replaced and/or modified

## Arm and Take-off

❏ Set flight mode to stabilize and Arm

❏ Take-off by raising the throttle

## Flight

❏ Stabilized
   
   ❏ Pitch/Roll/Yaw response 1:1
   
   ❏ Throttle response 1:1

❏ Altitude
  
   ❏ Vertical position should hold current value with stick centered
   
   ❏ Pitch/Roll/Yaw response 1:1
   
   ❏ Throttle response set to Climbs/Descend rate

## Landing  
   
   ❏ Land in either Stabilized or Altitude mode with the throttle below 40%
   
   ❏ Upon touching ground, copter should disarm automatically within 2 seconds
     *disarm time set by parameter: COM_DISARM_LAND

## Expected results

* Take-off should be smooth as throttle is raised

* No oscillations should present in any of the above flight modes

* Upon landing, copter should not bounce on the ground
