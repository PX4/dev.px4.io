# PX4 Development Guide

> **Info** Developers only! This guide is under active development and not intended for consumers.

This guide describes how to work inside the PX4 system architecture. It enables developers to:

* Get a [minimum developer setup](en/setup/config_initial.md).
* Understand the [PX4 System Architecture](en/concept/architecture.md) and learn how to modify the flight stack and middleware.
* [Build and deploy PX4](en/setup/building_px4.md) on _IntelÂ® Aero Ready to Fly Drone_, _Qualcomm Snapdragon Flight_, _Pixhawk_, _Pixfalcon_ and [many more autopilots](https://docs.px4.io/en/flight_controller/).
